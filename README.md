**CODEfury-Online Judge Platform 🚀**
**Overview**

 Yo fellow techies! Welcome to CODEfury-Online Judge Platform – the coolest code execution and judgment arena in town! 🎉 this platform lets you sling code like a pro and get instant verdicts on whether your creation is a masterpiece or a wild ride to the bug kingdom. 🐞

**Features**

Code Execution and Judgment: Submit your code in C, C++, or Python, and let the platform decide its fate. It's like a coding duel, but without the risk of losing a limb. 💻🤖

Google Authentication: No imposters here! Secure your spot with Google Authentication because we take user identity as seriously as cats take their naps. 😼🛡️

MERN Stack Magic: We've conjured the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack to give you an interface so smooth, it's like coding in zero gravity. 🚀🌌

Database Awesomeness: MongoDB stores your code secrets, user info, and more. It's like a digital vault for your genius creations. 🏰🔐

Scalability Vibes: Planning to party with Gunicorn and Nginx, so even if 500 friends crash the coding fiesta, the server stays cool and collected. 😎🚀

**Project Structure**

Our backstage is as organized as a neat codebase:

Frontend (React.js): The stage where the magic happens, built with React.js and CSS. It's like a rock concert for your code. 🎸🎤

Backend (Node.js and Express.js): The code maestro orchestrating everything with Node.js and Express.js. It's like the DJ spinning beats for your code party. 🎧💻

Database (MongoDB): MongoDB – where we stash the treasures of user info, code snippets, and secrets. It's like the hidden lair of a tech superhero. 🦸‍♂️🗃️

**Clone this awesome repo from GitHub.**

Fire up the dependencies for the frontend and backend with your favorite package manager.
Set up MongoDB like a boss or connect to an existing party database.
Configure Google Authentication for VIP access.
Peek into Docker for an extra layer of code party security. 🎉🚀
